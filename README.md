# Healthly
This is my first project on android. Not so fancy though, I have tried to use all the components I have learnt so far last week. 
The purpose of this app is to take input from user and show his/her Age, BMI rate and Max. Heart Rate based on the given input.
Android version:Marshmallow(7.1) or above
